# Instructions

- Your goal is to implement a model using any python library
that will recognize the text from the picture as accurate as possible.

- The dataset contained in `data/public_data` consist of images with English/Chinese texts
and `info.json` file with all ground truth texts.

- You should implement class located in `ocr_model.py`. Feel free to write any code you want,
but keep in mind that the model should match `OCRModel` interface, so I will be able to easily test it.
You can check your recognition quality on public data with `main.py` script.

- Your grade would depend on both the accuracy of your model
and the quality of your code.

  -  To measure your accuracy I will download your fork and 
run your model on the secret version of dataset (with another, but conceptually similar screenshots).


Good luck! And feel free to text me via email if you have any questions:
